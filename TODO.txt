Thank you for sharing your elevator system code. I've reviewed the files you provided, and I can see that you've already implemented a solid foundation for an elevator control system. Let's analyze the current structure and discuss ways to make it more sophisticated and complex.

Current Structure:
1. Button class: Handles button press events
2. Controller class: Manages the overall system
3. Elevator class: Represents the elevator and its operations
4. Floor class: Represents individual floors and their requests
5. Screen class: Displays elevator information

To make the system more sophisticated, we can introduce new classes, implement inheritance, and add more advanced features. Here are some suggestions:

1. Implement an abstract base class:
Create an `ElevatorComponent` abstract base class that `Button`, `Screen`, and other hardware components can inherit from. This will allow for a more unified interface for all elevator components.

```cpp
class ElevatorComponent {
public:
    virtual void initialize() = 0;
    virtual void update() = 0;
    virtual ~ElevatorComponent() = default;
};
```

2. Create a Building class:
Introduce a `Building` class that contains multiple `Elevator` objects and manages them collectively. This will allow for multi-elevator systems.

```cpp
class Building {
private:
    std::vector<Elevator> elevators;
    std::vector<Floor> floors;
    Controller controller;
public:
    Building(int num_elevators, int num_floors);
    void assignElevator(int floor, int direction);
    void updateElevators();
};
```

3. Implement different elevator types:
Create subclasses of `Elevator` for different types, such as `PassengerElevator`, `FreightElevator`, and `ExpressElevator`. Each type can have unique properties and behaviors.

```cpp
class PassengerElevator : public Elevator {
public:
    PassengerElevator(int num_floors);
    void openDoors() override;
    void closeDoors() override;
};

class FreightElevator : public Elevator {
private:
    double maxWeight;
public:
    FreightElevator(int num_floors, double max_weight);
    bool checkWeight(double load);
};
```

4. Add a scheduling algorithm:
Implement a more advanced scheduling algorithm in the `Controller` class, such as the "Nearest Car Algorithm" or "Look Algorithm," to optimize elevator assignments and reduce wait times.

5. Introduce a maintenance system:
Create a `MaintenanceSystem` class that monitors elevator health, schedules maintenance, and handles emergency situations.

```cpp
class MaintenanceSystem {
private:
    std::vector<Elevator*> elevators;
    std::queue<MaintenanceTask> tasks;
public:
    void scheduleMaintenanceCheck(Elevator* elevator);
    void handleEmergency(Elevator* elevator);
    void performMaintenance();
};
```

6. Implement a power management system:
Add a `PowerManagementSystem` class to handle power consumption, energy-saving modes, and power outage scenarios.

7. Create a user interface:
Develop a `UserInterface` class that provides a text-based or graphical interface for monitoring and controlling the elevator system.

8. Add sensors and safety features:
Implement classes for various sensors (e.g., `WeightSensor`, `DoorSensor`, `SpeedSensor`) and safety mechanisms (e.g., `EmergencyBrake`, `Intercom`).

9. Implement logging and statistics:
Create a `Logger` class to record system events, and a `StatisticsTracker` to analyze elevator usage patterns and performance metrics.

10. Use design patterns:
Incorporate design patterns such as Observer (for updating floor displays), State (for elevator states like moving, stopped, or maintenance), and Factory (for creating different types of elevators).

These suggestions will significantly increase the complexity and sophistication of your elevator system. They introduce new classes, inheritance hierarchies, and advanced features that are common in real-world elevator systems.

To implement these changes, you'll need to modify your existing classes and create new ones. You'll also need to update the `Controller` class to manage these new components and features.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of these suggestions or provide code examples for implementing any of these features?
